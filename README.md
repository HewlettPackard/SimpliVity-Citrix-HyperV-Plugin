# Automation for Citrix Cloud on HPE SimpliVity (Hyper-V)

HPE SimpliVity plugin for Citrix Cloud is an automated tool to install or uninstall citrix cloud connector of a resource location on SimpliVity Hyper-V server.

## Release Notes

This is the first version of HPE SimpliVity plugin for Citrix Cloud which installs and configures Citrix Cloud connector. Major aspects of this plugin that are covered in this release are:

- Proxy implementation is a preview feature (beta) in version 1.0
- Secure SSL/HTTPS enabled on SimpliVity OmniCube controller (OVC) IP address to connect using REST APIs
- DHCP Server is required for assignment of IPâ€™s to Cloud Connector VMs
- VM template is tested on Windows 2016 Operating System

Few caveats of this Hyper-V plugin:
- SCVMM templates are not stored in SimpliVity and base VM satisfying the template requirements are used to perform SimpliVity clone
- Hosts in SimpliVity clone are automatically selected during deployment. Live migration should be working in the SCVMM setup to migrate VM to the user specified host. If live migration is not supported, VM placement is not guaranteed to reside on the specified host
- SCVMM should run on default port 8100

## Citrix Cloud Connector

Citrix Cloud Connector acts as an interface between the Citrix Cloud and on-premise resource location. This helps in managing the hosts and virtual desktops from the cloud by removing the need for complex solutions and networking. Each resource location is recommended to have more than one cloud connector to provide high availability (HA). However, it is laborious to configure or de-configure Citrix Cloud Connector whenever a resource location is created or deleted.

This plugin automates the installation of Citrix Cloud connectors by deploying virtual machines (VMs), adding them to Active Directory (AD), downloading Citrix Cloud Connector and installing it.
